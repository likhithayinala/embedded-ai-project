Outfit Recommendation: Okay, based on your existing wardrobe and the current weather (broken clouds, 12.37°C), here's a detailed outfit recommendation:

**Outfit:**

*   **Base:** A comfortable t-shirt and jeans. This is a versatile starting point that can be easily layered.

*   **Outer Layer:** Since the temperature is cool, go for one of your winter jackets. This will provide the necessary warmth while remaining suitable for the broken clouds. Consider choosing a jacket color that complements your t-shirt and jeans for a cohesive look.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Temperature:** 12.37°C is cool enough to warrant a jacket, but not so cold that you need heavy layers. Your winter jacket will offer sufficient insulation.
*   **Weather:** Broken clouds indicate partly sunny and partly cloudy conditions. A winter jacket is suitable for both scenarios.
*   **Your Wardrobe:** You have a casual outfit, suits, winter jackets, and t-shirts/jeans. Given that the prompt did not specify the need for formal attire, I suggest utilizing your t-shirts and jeans with the winter jacket.

**Additional considerations:**

*   **Footwear:** Wear appropriate shoes depending on the weather conditions. If the clouds are threatening rain, opt for water-resistant shoes. Otherwise, sneakers or casual boots would be a good choice.

This outfit will provide warmth and protection from the elements while maintaining a casual and comfortable style.
